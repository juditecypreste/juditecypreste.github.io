<p>The Brazilian is a natural-born soccer coach, with soul and heart. Because of this, the idea arose to understand how the Brazilian soccer fan reacted during the matches of the Brazilian national team during the World Cup. What were the favorite terms? How were the emotions during the plays? How did the fan behave and react to a goal or a yellow card? From scraping Twitter during all Brazilian national team matches and sentiment analysis, the Coração Radiante Project was born.</p>
